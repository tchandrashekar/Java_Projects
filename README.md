Atm_Project

This is the basic atm application project where it performs atm operations like :
* Pin Generation
* Depoist
* Cash Withdrawl
* Balance Enquiery
* Pin Change
* Exit

Every time we perform a new operation this application code will take input from the user like user_account_no and pin_no and it checks with the existing details of the customer from the bank, if both the details are matching then only they continue the operation they want to perform.Otherwise it displays wrong input or input mismatch. This is about the Atm_project
